## Matrix Inverse Problem 
## Matrix Inversion is a costly operation and with this program we try to cache any matrix inverse which was already computed
## makeCacheMatrix function gives utility methods getters/setters to access the inverse of a matrix. (Which is set in a different environment using <<- operator)


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inverse <- NULL
  
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inverse <<- NULL
  }
  
  get <- function() x
  
  setinverse <- function(inv) inverse <<- inv
  
  getinverse <- function() inverse
  
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)

}

# Cache Solve method takes makeCacheMatrix object and finds if the inverse of the given matrix is already in cache. If available in cache, retrive and use it
# If the inverse is not already computed, compute the matrix inverse using solve(X) method and store it using setinverse() method into the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inverse <- x$getinverse()
  
  if(!is.null(inverse)) {
    message("Getting Cached Data. ")
    return(inverse)
  }
  
  myMatrix <- x$get()
  # print(myMatrix) // Pring the Actual Matrix 
  inverse <- solve(myMatrix)
  x$setinverse(inverse)
  inverse # Returns Inverse of the matrix
}
